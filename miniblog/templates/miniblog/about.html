<h4 class="container p2">The most traditional page on any blog is the About page.
This page tells new visitors to your blog what it is about, who you are and why you have a blog about your particular topic.
Depending on your niche and your style, the information you provide can be “all business” or personal and fun.
It’s helpful to include a simple sentence or two about you and your blog for new visitors who may not take the time to read your About page.
Having your photo included in this blurb of text helps visitors to put a face to the blog,
whether you are the owner and editor managing other writers, or the primary content author.
